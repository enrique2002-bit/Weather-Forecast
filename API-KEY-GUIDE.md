Since your API keys are returning "invalid" errors, here's how to get a fresh, working key:

## Step 1: Visit WeatherAPI
Go to: **https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx**

## Step 2: Create Free Account
- Enter your email address
- Create a password
- Click "Sign Up" 
- Verify your email if required

## Step 3: Get Your API Key
- Login to: **https://www.weatherapi.com/my/**
- Copy your API key from the dashboard
- It will look like: `1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`

## Step 4: Update Your App
Open `src/script-multi-api.js` and replace line 12:
```javascript
key: 'YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE', // Replace this
```
